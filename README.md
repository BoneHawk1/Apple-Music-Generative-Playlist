## Features 
- Generate a playlist on any mood, emotion, style, or simlar artist!
- Completely Free!
- Use ChatGPT or a local LLM!
- Generate a playlist based on a passage, just share to the shortcut through the share sheet!

In order to use this with ChatGPT, you must have the ChatGPT app installed so you don't have to pay API fees. 

## Limitations
- This shortcut can only pull music from your library due to the nature of the Shortcuts app
- Works only about half of the time on HomePod
- Sometimes doesn't ave the songs to the playist, only adds them to queue

## Coming Soon
- Better docs
- Custom trained local LLM
- Video examples
